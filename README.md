# Individual-Project---Comparing-Nutritional-Quality-Across-Popular-Fast-Food-Chains

I plan to compare the nutritional content of menu items from major fast-food restaurants
(McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut) to determine which chains
offer the healthiest options. This interests me because millions of Americans eat fast food
regularly, yet many don't realize the nutritional differences between chains and menu items. It's
worth investigating because people can make better food choices when they understand which
restaurants and items are healthier, helping address obesity and diet-related health issues.
